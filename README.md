# Anomaly-Detection

The goal is to detect anomalies in the sensor readings of the Engineering sensors. 
The sensors of interest here are 13 Engineering sensors (1-13). 
The dataset has a length of 42070. 
The Machine Learning concept of Isolation Forest has been used to detect the anomalies. 
Further the detected anomalies have been analysed.
